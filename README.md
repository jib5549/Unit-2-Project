<div style="font-size: 25px">Prerequisites:</div>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon">nodemon</a>: It is recommended to have nodemon installed globally to automatically restart the server during development. If you don't have nodemon installed globally, follow the command below to install it:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code>npm install -g nodemon</code>
</pre>


<div style="font-size: 25px">Getting Started:</div>
   <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository.</li>
    <li>Install project dependencies by running <code>npm install</code>.</li>
    <li>Create an '.env' file in the root directory of the project.</li>
    <li>In the '.env' file, define the following variables:</li>
  </ol>

  <pre><code>MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-mongodb-uri</code></pre>

  <p>Replace <code>mongodb://your-mongodb-uri</code> with your actual MongoDB cluster.</p>

  <div style="font-size: 25px">Running the Project:</div>
  <p>To start the project, run the following command:</p>

  <pre><code>asdasdasdasdasd</code></pre>

  <p>The application should now be running on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<div style="font-size: 25px">Diagram:</div>
<p>This diagram shows the attributes of each model and the associations between the models. Each model has a primary key, you can locate it by looking for the key icon, which are specific to each of its own identity and with that you can connect with other models through a unique key. It's important to understand the relationships between the entities. In this scenario, we can see that each user can have multiple carts and a cart can have multiple items.</p>
